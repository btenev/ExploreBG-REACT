This is the Devil's Bridge, also known as Shaytan Kypriya. For nearly 500 years, the waters of the Arda have crashed against its foundations, yet it stands proudly and majestically, untouched by the ravages of time. Even today, the secret of the master who built this strong and stable structure, seemingly impervious to the forces of nature and the changes over the centuries, remains undiscovered.",
